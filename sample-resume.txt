EXPERIENCE
Honeywell | UX Manager / Lead | Charlotte, NC | April 2021 – Present
Leading global discovery and strategy for enterprise safety platforms, serving 80K+ users in high-compliance environments.

Strategic Pivot & Executive Alignment (EWAS Platform):
• Led the discovery phase for the Enterprise Worker & Asset Safety (EWAS) platform transformation. Conducted deep-dive current state audits of fragmented legacy tools, mapping redundant paths and friction points.
• Pivoted product strategy following critical CTO guidance and stakeholder workshops, moving from a complex manual configuration model to a "Guided Onboarding" and AI-assisted workflow.
• Defined the strategic vision for NFC/QR-based device assignment, a key differentiator that eliminated manual entry errors and streamlined shift handoffs.

Discovery Workshops & Divergent Concepting (Vertex One):
• Facilitated multi-day discovery workshops with cross-functional stakeholders (Engineering, Product, Field Services) to deconstruct service inefficiencies in semiconductor fabs.
• Generated divergent HMI concepts to solve for high-risk "pump maintenance" scenarios, using wireframes to visualize complex logic before converging on a solution.
• Synthesized qualitative data from Voice of Customer (VOC) sessions using AI clustering to identify high-value opportunities, directly influencing the roadmap for predictive maintenance features.

Validation & Iteration:
• Conducted 100+ usability tests and field observations to validate hypotheses; iterated designs based on quantitative success metrics, reducing configuration time by 20%.

Design Leadership:
• Directed a global team of 20+ designers, establishing "Design Quality" reviews and mentoring staff on discovery methods and hypothesis-driven design.

Wells Fargo | Lead UX Designer (Contract) | Charlotte, NC | January 2021 – April 2021
Driven solution discovery for enterprise audit applications within a highly regulated financial environment.
• Collaborated in an Agile environment to align strategic requirements between Product Management and Engineering, reducing rework and clarifying scope early in the discovery process.
• Created high-fidelity interactive prototypes in Axure to facilitate stakeholder storytelling, securing alignment on complex audit workflows before development.
• Influenced the adoption of modern design thinking practices across teams to improve cross-functional cohesion.

Ecomdash (Endurance Group) | Senior UX Designer | Charlotte, NC | November 2019 – December 2020
Established the design strategy that contributed to the acquisition by Endurance Group (Constant Contact).
• Problem Discovery: Analyzed onboarding friction using Hotjar and Google Analytics, creating journey maps that identified critical drop-off points.
• Strategic Impact: Introduced design thinking frameworks that led to a 20% increase in conversion rates.
• Solution Delivery: Designed a multi-channel analytics platform unifying data from 15+ shopping APIs (Amazon, Shopify, eBay) into a single decision-making dashboard.

Bank of America | Senior UX Designer (Contract) | Charlotte, NC | March 2019 – November 2019
Optimized enterprise financial tools for internal audit and compliance operations.
• Facilitated design thinking workshops to align diverse stakeholders on workflow improvements for data-dense financial applications.
• Developed user journey maps and accessible patterns for internal audit tools, ensuring alignment with complex regulatory requirements.
• Partnered with data teams to design responsive interfaces capable of processing large-scale transaction data.

Central Piedmont Community College | User Experience Instructor | Charlotte, NC | January 2019 – June 2022
• Taught discovery methods, prototyping, and design principles to 30+ students, mentoring them on how to articulate design strategy and rationale.
